In this assignment, I have created a simple serverless web application using AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB as the database service. The goal was to understand how to:
1.	Trigger a Lambda function using an API Gateway.
2.	Interact with DynamoDB to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
3.	Deploy and test the application in the AWS environment.
